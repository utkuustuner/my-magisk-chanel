# magisk-channels
Main reason why I have this repo is magisk in recovery method being deprecated and me wanting to preserve the versions that worked best for me. It's for my personal use but feel free to use it if you want.

A10 20.2 is recommended for initial booting of android 10 gsis.

- 21.0 is minimum for android 11,
- 19.4 is minimum for android 10 on a-only devices,
- 19.0 is minimum for android 10,
- 18.1 is minimum for huawei devices running emui 9

tbh I don't know why anyone would go lower than these versions but these are the hard floors

versions after 21.2 have some changes that makes apps recognize device arch as armvl8 instead of aarch64, you'd care about this if you're running a chroot envoirement inside android
